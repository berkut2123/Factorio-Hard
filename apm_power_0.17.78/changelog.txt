---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.38
Date: 18. 04. 2019
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed: that some burner fuel like 'coke briquett' has the wrong fuel-category, because I fxed a bug in the lib :/
  Changes:
    - item: removed: Battery (discharged) 'will be moved into a new mod'
    - entity: removed: Electric car 'will be moved into a new mod'

Version: 0.17.35
Date: 15. 04. 2019
  Minor Features:
    - naming: internal names and English localization aligned, for better search results in mods like FNEI (because they can only search for the internal name)
  Compatibility:
    - I have changed the calculations for fuel values, based on coal, there was a logical failure in it. This can result in unecpected high fuel values for follow-up products (in the chain) if an other mod overwrites the coal value, like Realistic Power does. The calculations should now hardened against this. (If an other mod overwrites the base value of coal, my setting for the value might be not functional in this case).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.34
Date: 14. 04. 2019
  Minor Features:
    - renamed the mod from 'Amator Phasma's Fuel & Power rework' to 'Amator Phasma's Coal & Steam'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.32
Date: 12. 04. 2019
