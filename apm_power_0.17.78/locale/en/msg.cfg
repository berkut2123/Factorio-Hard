apm_power_msg_01759=Hi,\n\nThis version (0.17.59) comes with a few recipe changes that I unfortunately can not migrate automatically, because they have something to do with fluids.\nAll electric offshore pumps have to be reset because they no longer deliver normal water, simply pick them up and place them again.\n\nHave fun!? ;>)\n\n
