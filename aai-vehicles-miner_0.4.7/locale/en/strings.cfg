[mod-setting-description]
start-with-vehicle-miner=Start with a free Mining Vehicle MK1
vehicle-mining-multiplier=A multiplier to the mining speed of mining vehicles. Setting a value of 50 means the vehicles mine at half speed.
vehicle-mining-disallow-resources=Enter the "resource-name" of resources you want to disallow, separate multiple with a space. Find names with the F4 debug tooltips option.
vehicle-mining-interval=The number of ticks between processing mining, low is smoother mining, high saves UPS.
vehicle-collection-interval=The number of ticks between processing tree, rock, and ground item collection, low is more frequent, high saves UPS.
