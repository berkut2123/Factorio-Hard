[mod-setting-description]
apm_lib_inserter_iterations_01759=Here you can set the maximum of how many inserters per tick should be checked by the script. This is important for the ability of the inserters to check and clear burned-fuel-inventorys on machines, chain fuel through machineries and for burner-inserter to pick up fuel from the pickup and drop targets for them self. (Default is 15 per tick -> 900 inserters/s)
apm_lib_storage_spit_out=This option controls if the inventory of destroyed storage containers should spit items out on the ground.
apm_lib_radiation_dmg=If activated, the character will be slightly damaged if it has a radioactive item in inventory or in hand.
