      This also means t1 recipes in a t4 machine should recycle them even faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: July 11, 2019
  Minor Features:
    - Fully featured Fantario compatibility.
      T1-3 machines rely on heat as power source; T4 machine locked behind space science.
