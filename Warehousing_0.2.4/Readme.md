### Latest

Now updated for Factorio 0.17! Just like the base-game research, technology requirements have been overhauled. There are now two levels of "Logistics Warehousing" to research, and Warehousing research in general is more expensive.

Crafting recipes were also updatedâ€”**no more wood!**

Building storage capacity (except logistic storage variants) was finally rebalanced to reflect the 3x3 and 6x6 entity sizes. Storehouses now accept 450+ stacks of items, and Warehouses take 1800+ stacks. The old capacities are accessible via a startup setting, if you have an existing map with circuit logic that will break with the changed inventory sizes.

Copying the research cost of "Logistic System" remains, as a startup setting (off by default, to save a bit of loading time). Enabling it will update the cost of "Logistics Warehousing 2" to match if you have a mod that changes the cost of "Logistic System". As before, report incompatible mods in [the forum thread][forum-thread] or [GitHub issue tracker][issue-tracker].

There's also a new setting to disable inventory icon scaling, if you don't like how the stretched icons look on top of your buildings.

Localizations for the new settings are almost entirely incomplete, except for a lucky few strings; [go to Crowdin][crowdin-project] if you can help translate them into more languages!

### Previously

Logistic warehouse research cost is now based on the cost of "Logistic System", for better balance when using mods that alter that research.

Warehouses were changed to 6x6 as per a suggestion, so if you are upgrading from a very old version of the mod it will make all existing warehouses potentially overlap and cause unknown issues. You have been warned! (If you've transitioned a steam power setup from Factorio 0.14 or below to 0.15, you know the pain.)

Factorio 0.12.18 allowed entity inventories to have scroll bars... Capacities were increased to take advantage of this. Please note that using significant numbers of warehouses _will_ cause a significant performance decrease. (Entity update performance is directly related to inventory slot count, so more slots to process on each tick means it will take longer.)


## Description

Adds 6x6 warehouses that allow you to store a lot of items, and smaller (cheaper) 3x3 storehouses with less capacity.

Warehouses and storehouses also have logistic versions (passive provider, active provider, storage, requester, and buffer), just like chests.

You can also attach red and green wires to the warehouses, and they'll attach to the correct points on the corner of the logistics warehouses.
