bobmods-lib-resource-generator=Bob's Ressourcen Generator


[mod-setting-description]
bobmods-lib-resource-generator=This library contains a Resource generator for 0.17, based on the 0.17 resource generator system. However, the version as part of 0.17.51 of Factorio fixes a lot of issues that this resource generator attempted to fix in the older version, and is no longer needed.\nThe library will check if the new generator is available and use it automatically, or use this generator if it is not, however, this option is available to force enable my custom generator even if you're using the newer version of Factorio.
