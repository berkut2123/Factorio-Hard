[mod-setting-description]
steam-turbines-enabled=Enable advanced steam turbines. If this option were deactivated, you will not be able see the steam turbines that this mod add in game and the exist will be removed on loading a game.\nThis setting is meant in the case that you use many mods that have reduntant/similar objects.
heat-exchanger-enabled=Enable advanced heat exchanger. If this option were deactivated, you will not be able see the heat exchanger that this mod add in game and the exist will be removed on loading a game.\nThis setting is meant in the case that you use many mods that have reduntant/similar objects.
