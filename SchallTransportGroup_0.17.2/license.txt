Exceptions to the no modification rule include:

    Minor bug fixes/tweak for compatibility reasons, such as altering the dependencies line in info.json to force a load order in a modpack.
    Config - Any config.lua file, including in the config mod may be edited and freely redistributed

Any further modifications, such as changing values of entities/recipes in my mods should be done externally in another mod, similar to how my own has dynamic recipes, or enables/disables certain things as needed.
An example of such a mod is this by Athmagor viewtopic.php?f=51&t=16786
