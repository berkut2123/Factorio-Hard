V 0.17.0 - Conversion to 0.17

Fast conversion, many things changed in the game and not everything causes an error, some weird things happened during tests, fixed what i could notice, but probaly missed something. Also, worms and spitters now do Acid damage and are imune to Acid, Heavy Tanks are also very resistent to acid... You receive almost no damage and your Acid weapons do Nothing. I will correct this on the next few days.

----------------------------------------

V 0.07 - Equipment Overhaul
-changed the cannon damage upgrade boost from 5/10/15 to 10/20/30
-Added uranium Shells with custom explosion, less expensive than a nuke, but less powerful too, BUT lot better animation. Very thx to me.
-Added ThunderStorm rocket pack, creates clouds that drop thunders for a long time. Less DPS than melting rockets, but last longer and is affected by wind.

----------------------------------------
V 0.06 - Quick fix
-Recipe "iodine-from-seaweed" now dont have a second product of nothing....factorio update decides that doing that to show the % is a crime.... for now the % is hidden but still 1% of chance.
----------------------------------------
V 0.05 - Complete Overhaul
-2 more tiers of heavy tanks
-Complete redone recipes for heavy tanks.
+ Now you need to craft 4 different parts and then assembly the heavy tank.
-Added "Crude Shells"
-Better icons for 120mm and 25mm munitions.
-Complete redone of the tech tree. (if you have some damage and speed upgrades, i'm sorry, but you will lost then)
-Heavy tank Tier 2 uses custom fuel that can be fabricated from oil derivates.
-Heavy tank tier 3 uses nuclear cells as fuel and added a new nuclear fuel made from iodine, (i know it's not exactly immersive, but fitted so well....and i have no other ideas ), but don't be fooled, you need a lot of energy to produce it and doesn't last much. Using on nuclear reactors is possible but not viable.
