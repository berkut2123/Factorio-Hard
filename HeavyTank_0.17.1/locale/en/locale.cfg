ExperimentalTank=Extinction Time!!

HeavyTank=Things are getting out of control, this planet is infested with those creatures and i think they are evolving,\ni could have sworn i saw one of them spitting fire and these corrosions in the armor appear to have been made with acid.\nMaybe i'm getting crazy, but if my craziness keeps me alive, then its worth it... \nAlso, i'm getting some very cool ideas, some servo drivers will boost the overhaul speed,\na massive gauss accelerator should be fun as well, but it's gonna need a lot of energy for this to work, hmm....\nMaybe something Nuclear...also that fire and acid stuff gives me some crazy ideas.
MediumTank=Bitters are ripping out small parts of the tank and spiters are piercing the steam tanks...\nNeed to upgrade the armor, the cannons also seem to need a better material. hmm...\nSteel has never failed me before, but gonna need a stronger and faster engine to handle this extra weight...
ScrapTank=I'm not alone here i know, a few turrets may hold on for a while, but if i going to survive, i will need more space and resources...\nThis tank from survival guide looks small and weak, need something more.... HEAVIER...
