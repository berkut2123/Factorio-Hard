[technology-name]
apm_nuclear_breeder=Nuclear breeding
apm_nuclear_breeder_thorium=Nuclear breeding with Thorium

[technology-description]
uranium-processing=Uranium ore is then processed into yellowcake and then on to uranium hexafluoride. Centrifuges enrich uranium hexafluoride as the basis for the later production of nuclear fuel cells.
uranium-ammo=Advanced ammunition from Uranium oxide pellet (0.2%) for higher hardness and weight, resulting in massive damage.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=The process of reprocessing used nuclear fuel and production of MOX fuel cells.
apm_nuclear_breeder=Nuclear breeding for the production of plutonium. The base of a high efficiency fuel cycle.
apm_nuclear_breeder_thorium=Nuclear breeding for the production of uranium. The base of a high efficiency fuel cycle.
