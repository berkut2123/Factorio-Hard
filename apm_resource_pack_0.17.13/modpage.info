__About this mod:__
-------------
This is not really a mod, because it does not do anything! The only reasons I have made this:
- I do not need to upload these media files if I fixed a bug in another mod, it's a little faster for me :)
- The user does not have to download much every time I fix a little thing.
- I have all icons and sprite sheets in one place, this prevents duplicates.
- Someone asks me if he can use my grahpics (I dont have any idea why because my artistic abilities are... :>) so anyone can use this know, without asking (although he would not have to do it, its under GPL/CC BY 4.0) with this pack.
