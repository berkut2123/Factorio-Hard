Version: 1.2.7
Date: 10. 09. 2019
  Changes:
    - Hidden optional dependency on Dectorio, to smooth out lamp colour order issues with DLL + Dectorio + Industrial Revolution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 09. 08. 2019
  Changes:
    - Copper lamp fuel recipes no longer need a dummy item.
    - Now uses util.parse_energy() to more reliably detect fuel values.
    - Seriously grunged the texture of the big lamp.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.5
Date: 01. 06. 2019
  Changes:
    - Added a lamp colours pass in data-final-fixes, so that other mods which add/change lamp colours are supported more generally (e.g. Six Bit Lamps).
    - The optional dependency on Dectorio was removed because it is now covered by the above change.
    - Squeak Through has been marked as incompatible. The special measures to fix its problems were removed. The incompatibility flag will be taken off once it stops breaking other mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 18. 05. 2019

    - More adjustments to undo collision box shenanigans caused by other mods not minding their own business.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
