[tips]
modname=[img=technology/deadlock-bronze-age] Welcome to the Industrial Revolution!
update=[img=technology/deadlock-bronze-age] Updated to Industrial Revolution v. __1__. See changelog for details.
001=[img=virtual-signal/signal-info] This is a tip. You can get another tip whenever you like by using the /tip command. You can also turn on rolling tips in Settings > Mod settings > Per player.
002=You will struggle without automated component crafting. [img=technology/automation] Automation research should be very high on your list of priorities.
003=Progression is loosely organised into "Ages". You begin in the Stone Age, unless you choose to skip it in Mod Settings in the "New game" menu.
004=All of the pre-electric machines (made from stone, copper or bronze) burn solid fuels, such as [img=item/wood]wood or [img=item/coal] coal.
005=[img=technology/deadlock-steam-power] Electricity is not accessible until the Iron Age.
006=[img=item/burner-mining-drill] Mining drills are more expensive to build and run, but all drills cover a larger area and mine faster than you might be used to.
007=The lowest level of the production chain has been completely changed. Check out your new Basic Products and Processing tabs.
008=[img=item/tin-ore] Tin and [img=item/gold-ore] gold ores are available to mine as well as the usual iron and copper. 
009=[img=item/iron-ingot] Iron smelting is a late Bronze Age technology. [img=item/gold-ore] Gold mining is achievable in the early Iron Age.
010=Smelting ore doesn't produce [img=item/copper-plate] plates. It produces [img=item/copper-ingot] ingots, which can be crafted into many things, including plates.
011=Smelting raw ore is relatively inefficient. If you follow the whole ore processing technology chain, you can double your ingot yield or more.
012=[img=item/inserter] Inserters can be tuned to drop onto either the far side or near side of a belt. You can disable this function in the mod settings.
013=Looking for [img=item/rubber-wood] rubber wood? The trees prefer a temperate and damp climate. You can adjust rubber tree coverage in map generation settings. Rubber wood saplings are also included in the optional starter kits.
014=Still banging rocks together, but want to build blueprints with bots? [img=item/heavy-armor] Heavy armour has a small equipment grid designed for powering [img=item/steambot] clockwork punkbots.
015=You have three new turrets to play with. [img=item/copper-turret] Scattergun and [img=item/gun-turret] minigun turrets fire physical projectiles.
016=In the Revolution, toolbelts are so 2018. But all five [img=item/modular-armor] armours bring an inventory bonus. Just be careful not to spill when you're changing armour sets.
017=Need to get rid of things, permanently? Use an [img=item/copper-incinerator] incinerator to destroy useless items. *cough*
018=You can [img=item/steel-scrap] scrap almost any item made of metals, stone, or glass, but it's not very efficient. Metal scrap and glass fragments can be smelted back into ingots.
019=Some components are physically possible but have no current use. You can hide or show these redundant components in the mod settings.
020=Bronze and copper machines can't be fitted with high tech modules. But many of them will accept a [img=item/simple-pollution-filter] pollution filter.	
021=For bigger, brighter lamps that align with rails and large power poles, as well as a big burner lamp, try Deadlock's Larger Lamps, on the mod portal today.
022=Wood can be important in the early phase of a game, and rubber wood can be important later. If trees are scarce, automate wood production with an [img=item/iron-forestry] auto-forester.
023=[img=item/carbon-gravel] Crushed coal burns cleaner than raw coal.
024=You can use [img=item/stone-gravel] gravels and [img=item/copper-gravel] crushed ores to create decorative flooring.
025=When activated, your personal generator manager (found in quickbar shortcuts) will top up your fuel when it falls below 10 in the slot, and empty any spent fuel items.
026=[img=item/iron-motor] Motors are small: they are used to move machine parts. [img=item/engine-unit] Engines are much heavier and can propel large vehicles.
027=For mass hoarding, build [img=item/bronze-storage-depot][img=item/steel-storage-depot] Storage Depots.
028=[img=item/rail] Rail is cheaper in the Revolution. It is based on iron rather than steel.
029=[img=item/cargo-wagon] Cargo wagons have double the internal space. [img=item/wooden-chest] Chests are also a bit more spacious.
030=Did you check all the starter options, map options and per-player settings yet?
031=Boost the yield from crude oil refining by gaining access to [img=recipe/advanced-heavy-oil-cracking] advanced cracking, which requires a [img=item/platinum-pure] platinum catalyst.
032=In the Revolution, [img=item/big-electric-pole] Big Electric Pole reach has been increased to one chunk (32 tiles).
033=You can program a [img=item/computer-mk1] computer to act as a [img=item/speed-module] module, and then reformat it later, returning the computer to its original state. 
034=[img=item/titanium-ingot] Titanium, [img=item/lead-ingot] lead, [img=item/chromium-pure] chromium and [img=item/platinum-pure] platinum are not mined directly. They are by-products of ore refining.
035=[img=item/electric-locomotive] Electric locomotives are an alternative to [img=item/locomotive] regular locomotives. They run on [img=item/charged-battery] charged batteries. They don't get the same range of fuel bonuses.
036=[img=item/accumulator] Accumulators are much more powerful here, but more expensive to build. In the vanilla game, one accumulator barely stores more energy than a single piece of coal.
037=Don't point the [img=item/chromium-photon-turret] Photonic Cannon towards your base. Really, don't.
038=Going for a long wander into the night? Maybe take some [img=item/charged-battery] charged batteries and [img=item/battery-discharge-equipment] personal discharge equipment with you.
039=Need to power a machine temporarily, but it's cut off from the main power grid? A [img=item/iron-battery-discharger] battery discharger might be useful.
040=A [img=item/magnetron] magnetron traps magnetic fields in rotating cavities to produce radio waves. It is a key component of radar systems.	
041=You can choose the colour of [img=item/laser-turret] laser beams in mod settings from the main menu.
042=They say [img=item/diamond-gem] diamonds are a girl's best friend. That girl is obviously an industrial mining specialist.
043=You will need [img=item/ruby-gem] rubies to create [img=item/laser] lasers. Better get that gold flowing.
044=Need to generate a force field? You'll need [img=item/field-effector] field effectors, and for that you'll need [img=item/sapphire-gem] sapphires.
045=Fusion power out of nothing is just a fantasy. But you can power your armour with a [img=item/fusion-reactor-equipment] portable fission reactor and [img=item/uranium-fuel-cell] uranium fuel cells.
046=In the Revolution, [img=item/solar-panel] solar panels are more efficient. You can also research [img=item/solar-array] solar arrays, which save even more space.
047=Don't like the pew-pew? Fair enough. You still need [img=item/ruby-gem] rubies, though - the highest tier of assemblers uses laser welders.
048=[img=item/productivity-module-3] Productivity modules are limited to resource processing, mining, and research.
049=Revolutionary theorists have recently begun speculating about an advanced form of research, based on [img=item/quantum-lab] quantum computing.
050=Rocket parts are made of [img=item/steel-bulkhead] steel bulkheads, [img=item/rocket-control-unit] rocket control units and [img=item/rocket-fuel] rocket fuel.
051=You don't need any rare metals to launch a rocket. But you do need them for satellites.
052=The Revolution will not be televised.
