##Angels and Santas - C.A.B. - Crawler Autonomous Base##

In collaboration with [lovely_santa](https://mods.factorio.com/user/lovely_santa) <3

Adds a late game variant of the crawler which can deploy on a spot to provide electric energy in a radius from it's own grid.
-C.A.B. Vehicle
-Deploy and Undeploy Charges
-Energy Transfer Port Equipment

-Can be used Independently
-Currently needs bobvehicle equipment to fully function

C.A.B. can be used as a regular transporter/car

Deployment and undeployment has to be "fired" from it's weapon slots and will use up a charge each time.

After deployment the C.A.B. is fixed to it's position but will provide electric power to it's surroundings

The C.A.B. needs the Energy Interface and an energy providing generator in it's grid
