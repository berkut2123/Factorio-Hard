# VortiK's Cannon Turret

Small mod that adds a cannon turret that can use specially manufactured tank shell magazine ammunitions.
- Good range (30 vs 18 for laser turrets) but a big minimum range too.
- Low rate of fire and rotation.
- Special munitions that don't collide with friendly entities like tanks shells
- Watch out for friendly fire still !
- Custom shooting sound : https://instaud.io/1Cm2
- New technology to make all walls and gates resistant to explosion damage type to better work with cannon turret. 90% resistance, should work for any modded wall and gate.
- An heavier cannon turret sporting double the rate of fire for even more firepower in less space, to compensate, it's expansive, has shorted range and a limited firing arc.

The goal of this mod was to make a different turret using tank shells but still close to Vanilla. Turret projectiles are identical to tank shells except they won't collide with friendly entities !

Inspiration from an old 0.12 turret mod : https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=14957 and sprite by the talented modder YuokiTani.
