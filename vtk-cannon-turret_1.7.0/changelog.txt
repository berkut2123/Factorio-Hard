Version: 1.7.0
Date: 07. 08. 2019
  Changes:
    - Increased cannon turret steel cost from 2 to 30 to account for their high HP.
    - Added heavy autocannon turret, expansive, less range, limited firing arc (2/5Â° = a bit more than the 1/3 of the flammer turret) but double the rate of fire ! Ideal for concentrating more firepower in less space.

Version: 1.6.0
Date: 07. 08. 2019
  Changes:

    - Wall explosion resitance down to 90% from 95%.
    - Added explosion resistance bonus to all wall and gate entity type making all modded walls and gates supported.
    - Adjustement to projectile_creation_distance from 1.75 to 2 that should prevent sometimes the cannon turret shooting itself under specific angles when some mods add a shield to the turret (ex : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Turret-Shields).
