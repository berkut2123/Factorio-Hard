**Q:** Why didn't the station update when I loaded my save?

**A:** Whenever a save is loaded, the tracked stations are cleared. A train sitting at a station will not update until the next time a train visits.

**Q:** When multiple mods have the same item, which color is used?

**A:** It is dependent on the load order in `colors/database.lua`. As of this writing, the original color database takes precedence over the auto-generated colors.
