**Automatic Train and Station Painter** extends **Automatic Train Painter** to optionally include painting stations. Stations, much like trains, are colored with a mixture depending on the cargo that flows through the station.

Stations that only receive items will be the colors of the items being delivered, slightly weighted toward newer deliveries.

Likewise, stations that only provide items will be the colors of the items provided, slightly weighted toward the last departure.

Stations that both receive and provide goods will use inbound and outbound colors to paint the station. As the previous two methods, the color blend will be weighted toward the more recent activity.
