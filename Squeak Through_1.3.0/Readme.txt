Squeak Through 1.3.0
====================

Version 1.3.0 was released February 27, 2019, and was tested using Factorio v0.17.02. It primarily features code by Nommy, with contribution from Lupin, and is maintained by Supercheese.

This small mod reduces the collision boxes for many structures, allowing you to "squeak through" them while walking around your base.
Say goodbye to the frustration of having your path blocked by your steam engines or solar panels when walking around your base!

You can toggle the collision box shrinking for each type of entity using the in-game mod settings. Altering these settings will require you to restart the game.
