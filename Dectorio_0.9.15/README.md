# Dectorio

Dectorio is a large mod that adds decorative elements to beautify your factory. New technology research is required to unlock the various items before they can be crafted and some default recipes are adjusted to better reflect how these items should be made.

Inspiration for the mod came from a lot of other mods on the portal, although all the assets in Dectorio have been custom made for this mod and are either modified versions of base game assets or created from scratch. If you'd like to use any of these in your own mod, please observe the GNU GPLv3 license.

Requires Factorio version 0.15 or later.

## Features

### Decorative items

* Adds traffic bollards for decorating roadways or protecting your factory from vehicular collisions

### General

* Includes settings for enabling or disabling each of the above features (Options > Mods > Startup). Ideally these should only be changed before starting a new game. Changes on existing games will require content to be migrated and some items may be lost if you disable components you've already used on an existing save. Always make a backup first!

* Items above marked ^ can be further customised in the mod settings dialog

Check out the [Mod Spotlight video by Xterminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OOs8o0dnug) to see the mod in action (note that this features an older version of Dectorio without some of the features mentioned above).

### Mod Compatibility

**Note:** If playing with Factorio 0.15, please download v0.7.6, or for Factorio 0.16, please download v0.8.11 as these are the last stable versions supported on these base game releases. v0.9.0 and later are only supported on Factorio 0.17.

Limited testing has been completed with other mods. Warnings will be shown in-game to highlight any known issues. If you come across a specific compatibility issue, please let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.

It is not recommended to use other coloured signal mods at the same time as Dectorio. This can cause coloured signals to be overwritten multiple times and lead to game-breaking compatibility issues with other mods. If you would like more colours, you can add these in the Dectorio config.lua file (instructions are in the file). For full details, visit the [FAQ](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Dectorio/faq).

Dectorio includes specific support for [Alien Biomes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-biomes).
